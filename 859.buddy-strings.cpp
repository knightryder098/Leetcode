 * Testcase Example:  '"ab"\n"ba"'
 *
 * Given two strings s and goal, return true if you can swap two letters in s
 * so the result is equal to goal, otherwise, return false.
 * 
 * Swapping letters is defined as taking two indices i and j (0-indexed) such
 * that i != j and swapping the characters at s[i] and s[j].
 * 
 * 
 * For example, swapping at indices 0 and 2 in "abcd" results in "cbad".
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: s = "ab", goal = "ba"
 * Output: true
 * Explanation: You can swap s[0] = 'a' and s[1] = 'b' to get "ba", which is
 * equal to goal.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: s = "ab", goal = "ab"
 * Output: false
 * Explanation: The only letters you can swap are s[0] = 'a' and s[1] = 'b',
 * which results in "ba" != goal.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 3:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: s = "aa", goal = "aa"
 * Output: true
 * Explanation: You can swap s[0] = 'a' and s[1] = 'a' to get "aa", which is
 * equal to goal.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 
 * 1 <= s.length, goal.length <= 2 * 10^4
 * s and goal consist of lowercase letters.
