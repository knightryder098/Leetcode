 *
 * In this problem, a rooted tree is a directed graph such that, there is
 * exactly one node (the root) for which all other nodes are descendants of
 * this node, plus every node has exactly one parent, except for the root node
 * which has no parents.
 * 
 * The given input is a directed graph that started as a rooted tree with n
 * nodes (with distinct values from 1 to n), with one additional directed edge
 * added. The added edge has two different vertices chosen from 1 to n, and was
 * not an edge that already existed.
 * 
 * The resulting graph is given as a 2D-array of edges. Each element of edges
 * is a pair [ui, vi] that represents a directed edge connecting nodes ui and
 * vi, where ui is a parent of child vi.
 * 
 * Return an edge that can be removed so that the resulting graph is a rooted
 * tree of n nodes. If there are multiple answers, return the answer that
 * occurs last in the given 2D-array.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: edges = [[1,2],[1,3],[2,3]]
 * Output: [2,3]
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: edges = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[4,1],[1,5]]
 * Output: [4,1]
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 
 * n == edges.length
 * 3 <= n <= 1000
 * edges[i].length == 2
 * 1 <= ui, vi <= n
 * ui != vi
 *
