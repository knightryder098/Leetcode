 *
 * A complex number can be represented as a string on the form
 * "real+imaginaryi" where:
 * 
 * 
 * real is the real part and is an integer in the range [-100, 100].
 * imaginary is the imaginary part and is an integer in the range [-100,
 * 100].
 * i^2 == -1.
 * 
 * 
 * Given two complex numbers num1 and num2 as strings, return a string of the
 * complex number that represents their multiplications.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: num1 = "1+1i", num2 = "1+1i"
 * Output: "0+2i"
 * Explanation: (1 + i) * (1 + i) = 1 + i2 + 2 * i = 2i, and you need convert
 * it to the form of 0+2i.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: num1 = "1+-1i", num2 = "1+-1i"
 * Output: "0+-2i"
 * Explanation: (1 - i) * (1 - i) = 1 + i2 - 2 * i = -2i, and you need convert
 * it to the form of 0+-2i.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 
 * num1 and num2 are valid complex numbers.
