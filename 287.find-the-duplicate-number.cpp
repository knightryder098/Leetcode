 *
 * Given an array of integers nums containing n + 1 integers where each integer
 * is in the range [1, n] inclusive.
 * 
 * There is only one repeated number in nums, return this repeated number.
 * 
 * You must solve the problem without modifying the array nums and uses only
 * constant extra space.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: nums = [1,3,4,2,2]
 * Output: 2
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: nums = [3,1,3,4,2]
 * Output: 3
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 
 * 1 <= n <= 10^5
 * nums.length == n + 1
 * 1 <= nums[i] <= n
 * All the integers in nums appear only once except for precisely one integer
 * which appears two or more times.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Follow up:
 * 
 * 
 * How can we prove that at least one duplicate number must exist in nums?
 * Can you solve the problem in linear runtime complexity?
